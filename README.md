# Object-Oriented Programming with Python
Hey guys, I'm polishing my skills for the placement interviews. This is the practice repo that I've created to practice and polish my OOP concepts.\
There's more to come. I'll keep updating this as I learn further, and also push more concepts that I will learn.

This repository contains information about OOP concepts like:
- Defining a class with its attributes.
- Concept about a constructor.
- Creating an instance of the class.
- Adding a method to the class.
- Inheritance.
- Understanding the use of the `super()` method that inherits attributes from another class.
- Encapsulation concepts - How to make an attribute private.
- How to access a private attribute.
- Polymorphism.

Again, I wish me luck in cracking this offer. üôè
